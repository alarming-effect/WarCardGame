//		3.  Tips:  Printing out information throughout the game adds value including easier debugging as 
		//	you progress and a better user experience.
//		a.  Using the Card describe() method when each card is flipped illustrates the game play.
//		b.  Printing the winner of each turn adds interest -- or a message indicating a tie.
//		c.  Printing the updated score after each turn shows game progression.
//		d.  At the end of the game: print the final score of each player and the winner’s name or “Draw” 
		//if the result is a tie.
